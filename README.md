# VanTechWeb #
### A Website to Connect Developers With Vancouver Tech Companies ###

This was a team collaboration that was built over a weekend. It uses APIs to
populate data in the news feed, Twitter feed, calendar events and Google maps.
It was created as a RESTful API, with user authentication, image upload
capability and search tools. There was also an administration dashboard where
the admin authenticated user could change organizations, edit and delete statuses,
and create new events.  

**The backend used Postgres, Ruby on Rails and SQL, while the front end utilized
Materialize, jQuery, AJAX, CSS, and HTML.**
